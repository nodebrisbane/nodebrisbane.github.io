<h1>Node Brisbane</h1>

Node Brisbane is committed to making our talks, pub meets, and other events a safe and enjoyable place for everyone.

<hr />

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>The Node Brisbane community has proven to be a very welcoming and open group. By joining that group as an attendee, speaker, or sponsor, you will be held to that same high standard.</p>

<p>Node Brisbane is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone.</p>

<p></p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body sise, race, age, religion (or lack thereof)
  <li>Sexual images in public spaces
  <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
  <li>Harassing photography or recording
  <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events
  <li>Inappropriate physical contact
  <li>Unwelcome sexual attention
  <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour
  <li>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.
</ol>

<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>

<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues, conference-related social events and online spaces.</p>

<h2>If you are being harassed</h2>
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please get in touch with us. You can make a report either personally or anonymously.

<h2>Anonymous report</h2>
You can use our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSexx6kqz-n--WqSx1ZjfmTAuxpWGewkw6Oobr_3z-32qnYuOQ/viewform">anonymous report form</a>. We can't follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.

<h2>Personal report</h2>
When taking a personal report, we will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. We may involve other event organisers to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.

We will be happy to help you contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

Contacts you can speak to confidentially at or outside of an event include:

<ol>
  <li><b>Kartik Gupta</b> - 0413 643 373</li>
  <li><b>Stephanie Leahy</b> - 0437 965 052</li>
</ol>
